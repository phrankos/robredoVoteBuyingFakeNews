							<h1>Overview</h1>
							<p><b><span style="color: #f24a4a;">Vote buying</span></b> is a malpractice in which a candidate, or their supporters, offer incentives (i.e. money, goods) to voters in exchange for their vote.
								According to an article published by PhilStar, Filipino voters have had no trouble accepting money from candidates during election seasons.
								However, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) has made it clear that this is a serious offense and violators will be arrested.
								<span style="color: #4f8fff;">During the 2022 elections</span>, candidates and their teams took to social media to expand the reaches of their campaigning.
								As such, supporters of candidates would often take this opportunity to slander other candidates.
								Some accusations these supporters hurl involve calling out the opposition for engaging in <span style="color: #f24a4a;">vote-buying</span>.</p>

						<div class="inner">
							<h1>Data Collection</h1>
							<p>We scraped <span style="color: #4af2f2;">Twitter</span> for all tweets about vote buying in <span style="color: #4e8fff;">the 2022 elections</span>.
								The official start and end of the 2022 Philippine election period as presecribed by the COMELEC was from January 9 to June 8, 2022.
								<span style="color: #ff4b4b;">Vote buying</span> is among the many prohibited acts during the election period. <a href="https://aceproject.org/main/samples/ei/eix_c055.pdf">See here</a></p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-search"></span>
									<h3>Scope</h3>
									<p>Due to the extensive scope, we have narrowed down the candidates to the top 3 presidential candidates in <span style="color: #4e8fff;">the 2022 Philippine elections</span>.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-tags"></span>
									<h3>Keywords</h3>
									<p>The keywords we used to scrape tweets are as follows:<br>
										"vote buying", 
										"vote-buying"<br>
										"bumibili ng boto", 
										"bumili ng boto"<br>
										and other variants. In no specific order.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-wrench"></span>
									<h3>Tools</h3>
									<p>For scraping tweets we used
										<span style="color: #96d700;">Ap</span><span style="color: #ff9013;">if</span><span style="color: #71c5e9;">y's</span>
										<span style="color: #4af2f2;">Twitter</span> <a href="https://apify.com/quacker/twitter-scraper">scraper</a>. It is a web scraping and automation platform that provides tools for extracting data from websites, in our case <span style="color: #4af2f2;">Twitter</span>.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-broom"></span>
									<h3>Data Cleaning</h3>
									<p>We performed data cleaning steps to ensure the quality, consistency, and analysis readiness of the collected data. Our tasks involved removing duplicates, handling missing or invalid data, normalizing text (e.g., removing special characters or URLs).</p>

				<!-- Data Exploration -->
				<section id="exploration" class="wrapper style2 fade-up">
					<div class="inner">
						<h1>Data Exploration</h1>
						<p>After we collected enough data to analyze, we need to explore the data we've 
							collected and make sure that it is clean and appropriate for our research objectives 
							before we jump to modeling and analysis.</p>
						<hr>
						<h2>Data Preprocessing</h3>
						<div class="features">
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-puzzle-piece"></span>
								<h3>Handling Missing Values</h3>
								<p>Some columns during our data collection had missing data. After some careful discussion, 
									we concluded that some of these columns were not relevant to our study hence we decided 
									to remove some of them. The remaining columns that were relevant to our study, had no missing values.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-table"></span>
								<h3>Ensuring Formatting Consistency</h3>
								<p>Upon inspection of our data, we discovered that formats involving time and date were not constant. 
									This was going to be a problem in the future when conducting statistical analysis. We manually went 
									through our dataset and corrected the format to better suit our needs.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-table"></span>
								<h3>Categorical Data Encoding for Candidates</h3>
								<p>One thing we did with our data was to identify which presidential candidate was being accused of 
									allegations of <span style="color: #ff4e4e;">vote buying</span> in the tweet. We decided to use 
									categorical data encoding for each tweet assigning the tweet to be either about 
									<span style="color: #ff3b3b;">Marcos</span>,
									<span style="color: #ff3bd1;">Robredo</span>,
									<span style="color: #758eff;">Pacquiao</span> or a mix of any of the three.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-table"></span>
								<h3>More Categorical Data Encoding</h3>
								<p>In our data encoding process, we categorized columns into categorical data, such as content type 
									(Rational or Emotional) for tweets. We also applied categorical data encoding to other columns 
									like Tweet Type, Account Type, and Rating. This approach improved our dataset analysis by organizing 
									and understanding the data based on different categories.</p>
							</section>
						</div>
						
						<hr>
						<h2>Outliers in the Data</h3>
						<p>In order to determine if there were any outliers in our data, we used the date posted as the column index.
							After obtaining their mean and standard deviation, we were able to tabulate the z-scores of every date in
							the data. Through this we were able to discover <span style="color: #ffac28;">1 outlier data</span>. This row 
							was then removed and not replaced since we had a surplus of data collected during the initial collection.</p>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/votebuying_data_01.png" alt=""></span>
						
						<hr>
						<h2>Time Series Analysis</h3>
						<p>The purpose of time series analysis is to understand insights from data that is collected over time. 
							In our topic, since we are using categorical data, we opted to use the Binning method. With a binning 
							interval of 1 month, we were able to observe and analyze long-term trends over time. This was done by 
							ensuring that the Date posted column was converted to the datetime Python format. After that, making us 
							of Pandas, we were able to create a new data frame with the binned time series analysis assigning it a 
							bin size of 1M or 1 Month. Finally using the pd.Grouper function from the Pandas library to specify the 
							grouping frequency for the time series data, we came up with the results below. Which we then tabulated 
							into a graph manually.</p>

						<h2>Natural Language Processing</h3>
						<div class="features">
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-language"></span>
								<h3>Tokenizing and Lower Casing</h3>
								<p>During this process, we had to translate the tweets first into English. We used googletrans to
									 translate the tweets into English. If we found the translation to be inappropriate or inaccurate, 
									 we manually translated the tweet ourselves. The tweets were then lowercased and had the punctuation 
									 marks removed. Afterwards, it was then tokenized with the NLTK Python library using its tokenize module.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-language"></span>
								<h3>Stemming and Lemmatization</h3>
								<p>To cater for future interest in text analysis, we deemed it necessary to reduce the number of vocabulary 
									in the tweets. After the previous step, we then used the NLTK library for its PorterStemmer and 
									WordNetLemmatizer modules to be able to reduce the words back to their base or root forms. One benefit 
									of this is that this simplification can improve the efficiency of text processing tasks and reduce the 
									computational resources required if we wish to pursue an in-depth text analysis of the tweets collected.</p>

						<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
						<div class="fit">
							<h3>Clustering</h3>
							<p>For the topic modeling, we used the <span style="color: #ffe44e;">Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)</span>. 
								<span style="color: #ffe44e;">LDA</span> is an algorithm that 
								identifies themes or topics within a group of documents (in this case the <span style="color: #4eedff;">tweets</span>). It then assigns 
								a relevance score to each document, indicating how closely it aligns with the identified topics. 
								A topic, in this context, refers to a collection of terms (words or phrases) that collectively 
								imply a common theme.<br>
								<br>
								We used the preprocessed <span style="color: #4eedff;">tweets</span> that underwent Tokenizing, Stemming, and Lemmatization.
							</p>
							<div class="fit iframe-container">
								<iframe src="./assets/Clustering.html" width="100%" height="100%"></iframe>
							</div>
							<p>
								After multiple attempts at finding the optimal number of topics that would provide us with a clear cluster of each candidate, we were unable to do so.
								The three topics seen above is the best option that we found. It is able to classify tweets targeting <span style="color: #ff3b3b;">Marcos</span> and <span style="color: #ff3bd1;">Robredo</span>. Albeit having some of the tweets alleging <span style="color: #758eff;">Pacquiao</span> mixed with some tweets of <span style="color: #ff3bd1;">Robredo</span>.
								<br><span style="color: #636efa;">Topic 1</span> is taken to be the general tweets allegations. This is attributed to some of the tweets not explicitly stating the name of the candidate in their tweet and only hinting towards them or using aliases.
								<br><span style="color: #ef553b;">Topic 2</span> is taken to be tweets targeting <span style="color: #ff3b3b;">Marcos</span>.
								<br><span style="color: #00cc96;">Topic 3</span> is taken to be tweets targeting <span style="color: #ff3bd1;">Robredo</span> but having some misidentified tweets supposedly for <span style="color: #758eff;">Pacquiao</span>.
								<br>This result can be explained by the fact that there are only few tweets collected determined to be alleging <span style="color: #758eff;">Pacquiao</span> compared to that of <span style="color: #ff3bd1;">Robredo</span> and <span style="color: #ff3b3b;">Marcos</span>.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<h3>Time Series Analysis</h3>
							<p>
								For the Time Series Analysis, we used the peak finding algorithm of the scipy library. This function  finds all local maxima by simple comparison of neighboring values. Optionally, a subset of these peaks can be selected by specifying conditions for a peak's properties.
								<br>
								<br>
								We tweaked the conditions for the algorithm so that it would make sense with our data.
							</p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-chart-bar"></span>
									<h3>Height</h3>
									<p>Height is the required height of a datapoint so that it will be classified as a peak.
										<br>
										We set this value to be the mean of the number of tweets for that candidate on that particular day.
									</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-chart-bar"></span>
									<h3>Threshold</h3>
									<p>Threshold is the required vertical distance to its neighboring samples so that it will be classified as a peak.
									<br>
									We set this value to be two times the standard deviation of the number of tweets for that candidate on that particular day.

							<br>
							<p>Based on the time series analyses above, the number of tweets accusing the candidates mostly peaked after the 2022 Election (May 9, 2022). This could be attributed to the fact that the candidate that the tweeter voted for lost the election. Another reason could be that the voters witnessed vote buying in their respective precincts and only tweeted about it after the election.</p>

								<span class="icon solid major fa-ban"></span>
								<h3>Hypothesis Test</h3>
								<p>Rejected the main hypothesis since only less than 50% of vote-buying allegations on <span style="color: #4eedff;">Twitter</span> were about <span style="color: #ff50ed;">former Vice President Leni Robredo</span>.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-clipboard-list"></span>
								<h3>More Hypothesis Tests</h3>
								<p>It was discovered from the Chi-square test of independence that both variables (Candidate Accused and Content Type) are not Independent. It simply means there is an association between the two variables.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-comments"></span>
								<h3>Topic Modeling</h3>
								<p>The model was able to cluster some topics correctly. However, it is not without error. This model may generate some issues in determining which candidate is being accused in a <span style="color: #4eedff;">Twitter</span>.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-chart-line"></span>
								<h3>Time Series Model</h3>
								<p>In the time series model, the number of tweets accusing the candidates mostly peaked after the 2022 Election. This model will help determine when vote buying tweets will surface.</p>

								<h2>Watchdogs</h2>
								<p>A group of computer science students focused on studying the issue of <b><span style="color: #ff4e4e;">Vote Buying</span></b> in the Philippines. We analyzed <span style="color: #4eedff;">tweets</span> from the 2022 National Elections to determine if a specific presidential candidate was frequently accused in these allegations.</p>
