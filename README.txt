Abstract:

This research matters since it explores the vote buying allegations on Twitter. The data collected comes from Tweets from the 2022 Election Period about vote buying. A non-parametric chi-square test was used to determine the dependence of the attributes.

Topic Modelling and Peak Detection models were created to predict which candidates are being accused on Twitter and to give an insight into when users might see tweets about vote buying. When improved, the model will properly classify the candidate accused in the tweet.

The practical implications of this research are to give future researchers and officials concerned with the election process insights into vote buying accusations on Twitter.

Robredo, despite having a lot of traffic during that time, was actually not the candidate with the most vote buying allegations. This research can also be basis for future studies looking into information on vote buying during national elections.
